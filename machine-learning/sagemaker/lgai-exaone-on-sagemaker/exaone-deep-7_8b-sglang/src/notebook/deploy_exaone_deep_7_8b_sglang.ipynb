    "# Deploy LG AI EXAONE Deep 7.8B on Amazon SageMaker AI with SGLang\n",
    "\n",
    "❗This notebook works well on `ml.g5.xlarge` instance with 50GB of disk size and `PyTorch 2.2.0 Python 3.10 CPU optimized kernel` from **SageMaker Studio Classic** or `Python3 kernel` from **JupyterLab**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that SageMaker provides [pre-built SageMaker AI Docker images](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/pre-built-containers-frameworks-deep-learning.html) that can help you quickly start with the model inference on SageMaker. It also allows you to [bring your own Docker container](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/adapt-inference-container.html) and use it inside SageMaker AI for training and inference. To be compatible with SageMaker AI, your container must have the following characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your container must have a web server listening on port `8080`.\n",
    "- Your container must accept POST requests to the `/invocations` and `/ping` real-time endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll demonstrate how to adapt the [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang) framework to run on SageMaker AI endpoints. SGLang is a serving framework for large language models that provides state-of-the-art performance, including a fast backend runtime for efficient serving with RadixAttention, extensive model support, and an active open-source community. For more information refer to [https://docs.sglang.ai/index.html](https://docs.sglang.ai/index.html) and [https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang).\n",
    "\n",
    "By using SGLang and building a custom Docker container, you can run advanced AI models like the [EXAONE Deep 7.8B](https://huggingface.co/LGAI-EXAONE/EXAONE-Deep-7.8B) on a SageMaker AI endpoint."

      "Okay, I need to list three countries along with their capitals. Let me start by recalling some countries and their capitals. First, I know that France's capital is Paris. That's straightforward. Then, maybe Japan? Their capital is Tokyo. Wait, but I should make sure. Let me think again. Yes, Tokyo is the capital of Japan. Third, perhaps Brazil? Their capital is Brasília. Hmm, but sometimes people might confuse it with Rio de Janeiro, which is a major city but not the capital. So Brasília is correct. Let me verify another one just to be safe. Maybe Canada? Their capital is Ottawa. But since the user asked for three, maybe stick with the first three I thought of. Alternatively, maybe include a different continent. Let me see. Alternatively, Germany's capital is Berlin. So maybe France, Japan, and Germany. Wait, but the user might expect more common ones. Alternatively, maybe include the United States? Their capital is Washington, D.C. So perhaps list three different continents. Let me see. Let me confirm each one again. France: Paris. Correct. Japan: Tokyo. Correct. Brazil: Brasília. Correct. Alternatively, maybe Canada: Ottawa. Or maybe Egypt: Cairo. Hmm. The user didn't specify any constraints, so any three countries are okay. Let me pick three that are commonly known. Maybe France, Japan, and Brazil. Alternatively, maybe include the UK? Their capital is London. But since the user might expect three, perhaps the first three I thought of are okay. Wait, but I should make sure that the capitals are accurate. Let me double-check each one quickly. France's capital is indeed Paris. Japan's is Tokyo. Brazil's capital is Brasília. Yes. Alternatively, maybe the user wants more diverse countries? Like one from Europe, one from Asia, one from South America. That could be good. Alternatively, maybe include an African country. Let me think. Let's see. Maybe Egypt as the third? Cairo. But perhaps the user wants three that are more commonly listed. Alternatively, the user might expect the first three countries that come to mind. Let me just go with France, Japan, Brazil. Alternatively, maybe the US, UK, and France. Let me see. The user didn't specify any order or region, so any three are fine. Let me just list three with their capitals. I think that's the task.

      "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So we have two sequences here: a_n and b_n. The sequence a_n starts with a_1 = 2, and the sequence b_n is an arithmetic sequence starting with b_1 = 2. The key equation given is that for all natural numbers n, the sum from k=1 to n of (a_k)/(b_{k+1}) equals (1/2)n2. We need to find the sum of the first 5 terms of a, which is a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_5. The options are given from A to E, so we need to figure out which one is correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let me recall what an arithmetic sequence is. An arithmetic sequence has a common difference between consecutive terms. Since b_1 = 2, then the general term for b_n should be b_n = b_1 + (n-1)d, where d is the common difference. But the problem doesn't specify the common difference, so maybe we need to find that as part of the solution?\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, the sequence a_n is just given as a sequence starting with 2, but we don't know if it's arithmetic or not. The problem doesn't specify, so I guess a_n could be any sequence, but we need to determine its terms based on the given condition involving the sum.\n",
      "\n",
      "The equation given is:\n",
      "\n",
      "Sum_{k=1}^n [a_k / b_{k+1}] = (1/2)n2 for all natural numbers n.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since this holds for all n, maybe we can use induction or find a recursive relation?\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me start by writing the equation for n=1, n=2, etc., and see if that helps.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with n=1:\n",
      "\n",
      "For n=1: The sum is just the first term, so a_1 / b_2 = (1/2)(1)^2 = 1/2.\n",
      "\n",
      "We know a_1 is 2, so plugging that in:\n",
      "\n",
      "2 / b_2 = 1/2 ⇒ b_2 = 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since {b_n} is arithmetic, the difference d can be calculated here. Since b_1 = 2 and b_2 = 4, the common difference d is 4 - 2 = 2. Therefore, the arithmetic sequence b_n is 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, etc. So general term is b_n = 2 + (n-1)*2 = 2n. Wait, that's simple. Let me check that: b_1 = 2(1)=2, b_2=2(2)=4, yes, so b_n = 2n. That seems straightforward. So that's the arithmetic sequence. So that part is settled. So b_{k} = 2k for any k. Therefore, b_{k+1} = 2(k+1).\n",
      "\n",
      "So the term inside the sum is a_k divided by 2(k+1). So the sum from k=1 to n of [a_k / (2(k+1))] equals (1/2)n2. Let me write that equation again with this substitution:\n",
      "\n",
      "Sum_{k=1}^n [a_k / (2(k+1))] = (1/2) n2.\n",

      "If we multiply both sides by 2, we get:\n",
      "\n",
      "Sum_{k=1}^n [a_k / (k+1)] = n2.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the key equation simplifies to Sum_{k=1}^n (a_k)/(k+1) = n2. That might be easier to work with.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, since this holds for all natural numbers n, perhaps we can consider the difference between the sum up to n and the sum up to n-1. That is, using the idea from telescoping series or recursive relations.\n",

      "Let me denote S(n) = Sum_{k=1}^n [a_k/(k+1)] = n2.\n",

      "\n",
      "Calculating the right-hand side: n2 - (n-1)^2 = n2 - (n2 - 2n +1) = 2n -1.\n",

      "\n",
      "Wait, that seems promising. Let me check this step again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, because S(n) = n2, so S(n) - S(n-1) = a_n/(n+1) must equal n2 - (n-1)^2 = 2n -1. Therefore, solving for a_n gives a_n = (2n -1)(n +1). So that's an expression for a_n in terms of n. Therefore, this formula should hold for all n ≥1. Let's verify it with n=1 first.\n",
      "\n",
      "For n=1: a_1 should be (2*1 -1)(1 +1) = (2-1)(2)=1*2=2. Which matches the given a_1=2. Good.\n",

      "Okay, so I need to list three countries and their capitals. Let me start by recalling some countries I know. Maybe start with the most common ones. Let's see... The first country that comes to mind is Germany. I think their capital is Berlin. Wait, is that right? Yeah, I'm pretty sure Berlin is Germany's capital. \n",
      "\n",
      "Next, maybe Japan? Their capital is Tokyo. That seems correct. I've heard that Tokyo is a major city there. Then, perhaps Brazil? Their capital is Brasília. Wait, is there another capital? Maybe Rio de Janeiro is a major city but I think the capital is Brasília. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing any up. Let me think again. For Germany, yes, Berlin is definitely the capital. Japan's capital is Tokyo. Brazil's capital is Brasília. Hmm, are there any other countries that might be more commonly known? Maybe France? Their capital is Paris. But the user asked for three, so maybe stick with the first three I thought of. Alternatively, maybe the US? The capital is Washington, D.C. But again, the user might prefer non-English speaking countries? Not sure. The question doesn't specify, so maybe any three are okay. Let me confirm the capitals again. \n",

      "Germany: Berlin. Correct. Japan: Tokyo. Correct. Brazil: Brasília. Yes. Alternatively, if I pick France, Paris is correct. But since the user didn't specify any constraints, maybe it's better to go with the first three that come to mind. Let me check again. Wait, maybe I should pick countries from different continents to make it more diverse. Germany (Europe), Japan (Asia), Brazil (South America). That could work. Alternatively, maybe include an African country? Let's see. Nigeria's capital is Abuja. But maybe that's less commonly known. The user might prefer more well-known ones. \n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the UK? Their capital is London. But again, the user might not mind. Since the question is straightforward, perhaps the first three I thought of are okay. Let me just list them again to be sure. \n",

Their capitals are Washington, D.C., Ottawa, and Canberra. But again, maybe the user wants non-English countries. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe France, Italy, and Spain? Their capitals are Paris, Rome, and Madrid. But again, the user might not mind. Since the question is open-ended, perhaps the first three I listed are acceptable. Let me just confirm each capital once more. \n",

Alternatively, if the user wants more variety, maybe include one from Africa or another continent, but without more info, sticking to the first three is safe. Alright, I'll go with those three.\n",
