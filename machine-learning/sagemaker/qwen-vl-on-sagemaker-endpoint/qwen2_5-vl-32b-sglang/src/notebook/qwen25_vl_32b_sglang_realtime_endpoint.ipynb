    "# Run Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct on Amazon SageMaker AI with SGLang\n",
    "\n",
    "❗This notebook works well on `ml.g5.xlarge` instance with 100GB of disk size and `PyTorch 2.2.0 Python 3.10 CPU optimized kernel` from **SageMaker Studio Classic** or `Python3 kernel` from **JupyterLab**\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that SageMaker provides [pre-built SageMaker AI Docker images](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/pre-built-containers-frameworks-deep-learning.html) that can help you quickly start with the model inference on SageMaker. It also allows you to [bring your own Docker container](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/adapt-inference-container.html) and use it inside SageMaker AI for training and inference. To be compatible with SageMaker AI, your container must have the following characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your container must have a web server listening on port `8080`.\n",
    "- Your container must accept POST requests to the `/invocations` and `/ping` real-time endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll demonstrate how to adapt the [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang) framework to run on SageMaker AI endpoints. SGLang is a serving framework for large language models that provides state-of-the-art performance, including a fast backend runtime for efficient serving with RadixAttention, extensive model support, and an active open-source community. For more information refer to [https://docs.sglang.ai/index.html](https://docs.sglang.ai/index.html) and [https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang).\n",
    "\n",
    "By using SGLang and building a custom Docker container, you can run advanced AI models like the [Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct)  model on a SageMaker AI endpoint."
